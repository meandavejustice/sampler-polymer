## Sample-polymer

An experiment with polymer elements. The goal is to have a `audio-pad` element
with much of the same functionality from my [simple-sampler](https://github.com/meandavejustice/simple-sampler) project.

There's nothing here yet except a styled element. Don't bother looking at the code yet plz.
